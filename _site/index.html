      <h1>"Well hello there."</h1>
      <p>So here's the deal. I am an awful human and neglected to update my portfolio site in 10 years. Needless to say, I have really grown as a designer since college. Rather than subject you to my shitty Cargo Collective filled with mediocre album artwork, I decided it was best to take it down. I have grand plans to rebuild (fingers crossed it doesn't take me another 10 years), however life and a couple a very needy furrbabies tend to get in the way. In the meantime please feel free to visit my <a href="https://www.behance.net/meaghanhendricks">behance</a> or <a href="https://dribbble.com/meaghanhendricks">dribbble</a>. Both of which I have at least managed to update within the last decade.</p>
      <p>Love Meaghan</p>
